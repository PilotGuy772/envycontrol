## Graphics modes

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

```
usage: envycontrol.py [-h] [-v] [-q] [-s MODE] [--dm DISPLAY_MANAGER] [--force-comp] [--coolbits [VALUE]] [--rtd3 [VALUE]] [--reset-sddm] [--reset] [--verbose]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Output the current version
  -q, --query           Query the current graphics mode
  -s MODE, --switch MODE
                        Switch the graphics mode. Available choices: integrated, hybrid, nvidia
  --dm DISPLAY_MANAGER  Manually specify your Display Manager for Nvidia mode. Available choices: gdm, gdm3, sddm, lightdm
  --force-comp          Enable ForceCompositionPipeline on Nvidia mode
  --coolbits [VALUE]    Enable Coolbits on Nvidia mode. Default if specified: 28
  --rtd3 [VALUE]        Setup PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management on Hybrid mode. Available choices: 0, 1, 2, 3. Default if specified: 2
  --reset-sddm          Restore default Xsetup file
  --reset               Revert changes made by EnvyControl
  --verbose             Enable verbose mode
```

### üìñ Some examples

Set graphics mode to integrated:

```
sudo envycontrol -s integrated
```

Set graphics mode to hybrid and enable coarse-grained power control:

```
sudo envycontrol -s hybrid --rtd3
```

Set graphics mode to nvidia, enable ForceCompositionPipeline and Coolbits with a value of 24:

```
sudo envycontrol -s nvidia --force-comp --coolbits 24
```

Set current graphics mode to nvidia and specify to setup LightDM display manager

```
sudo envycontrol -s nvidia --dm lightdm
```

Query the current graphics mode:

```
envycontrol --query
```

Revert all changes made by EnvyControl:

```
sudo envycontrol --reset
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Getting EnvyControl

### Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/envycontrol))

1. `yay -S envycontrol`
2. Run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` to switch graphics modes

### From source

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol.git` or download the latest tarball from the releases page
2. Run the script from the root of the repository like this `python envycontrol.py -s <MODE>`

üí° Replace `python` with `python3` on Ubuntu/Debian

### Install globally as a pip package

- From the root of the cloned repository run `sudo pip install .`
- Now you can run `sudo envycontrol -s <MODE>` from any directory to switch graphics modes.

## üì¶ Gnome Extension

The [GPU profile selector](https://github.com/LorenzoMorelli/GPU_profile_selector) extension provides a simple way to switch between graphics modes in a few clicks, you can get it from [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5009/gpu-profile-selector/).

**Make sure to have EnvyControl installed globally!**

## üí° Tips

### Wayland session is missing on Gnome 43+

Latest changes in GDM now require `NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations` kernel parameter to be set to 1 as well as `nvidia-suspend` services to be enabled for Wayland sessions to appear.

```
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-{suspend,resume,hibernate}
```

### `/usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsetup` is missing on my system

Please run `sudo envycontrol --reset-sddm`.
